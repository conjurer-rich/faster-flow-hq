## Fast Flow for Org Designers and Transformation Leaders

When your org is built for yesterday, even small changes feel hard. The Fast Flow Facilitator Platform gives you tools to uncover misalignments, guide better structural decisions, and evolve with purpose—not chaos.

## You’re trying to…

- Align teams with strategy
- Reduce friction between teams
- Design structures that adapt over time
- Avoid yet another failed reorg

But without a clear picture of how value flows—or where it’s blocked—it’s impossible to lead change with confidence.

## How the Fast Flow Platform helps

**Clarity** – Map current value flow, user needs, and where misalignment lives

**Confidence** – Use Flow Decision Records to guide and document the “why” behind every change

**Credibility** – Bring leaders and teams into the process with visual, participatory methods

## Techniques you can use right now

- **User Needs Mapping** – identify where boundaries should shift
- **Flow Signals Radar** – assess where friction is slowing you down
- **Flow Clinics** – co-create decisions with those closest to the work
