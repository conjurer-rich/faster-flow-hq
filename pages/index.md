![The Fast Flow Platform](/assets/images/fast-flow-platform-star.png){: .align-right width="400px"}

## A unified system to support facilitator-led change

The Fast Flow Platform is designed to help facilitators sense friction, guide structural decisions, and align teams with what matters—without getting stuck in top-down reorgs or endless workshops.

- Reduce cognitive load
- Improve flow of change and value
- Support intentional, repeatable progress

## The engine that turns signals into momentum

The Flywheel is the core mechanism facilitators use to move from sensing to doing—turning signals into decisions, and decisions into flow.

It connects:

- Flow Signals → friction in the system
- Fast Flow Plays → repeatable responses
- Flow Decisions → decentralized alignment
- Flow Roadmaps → visible progress
