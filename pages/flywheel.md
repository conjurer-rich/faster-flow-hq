## The Fast Flow Flywheel

![The Fast Flow Flywheel](/assets/images/fast-flow-flywheel.png){: .align-center width="400px"}

A momentum-building system to guide structural evolution and unlock flow.

## What is the Fast Flow Flywheel?

The Fast Flow Flywheel is the core engine of the Fast Flow Platform.

It‚Äôs not a framework or a maturity model‚Äîit‚Äôs a practical, repeatable approach that helps facilitators and change agents move   from sensing friction to making aligned, intentional decisions that improve the flow of value.

Where most transformation tools stop at diagnosis or vague advice, the Flywheel provides a pathway from insight to action‚Äîagain and again.

## Why a Flywheel?

Because flow doesn‚Äôt come from a single intervention.
It comes from small, repeatable moves that build alignment, reduce friction, and accelerate progress over time.

The more you use it, the easier it becomes to spot flow problems, apply effective plays, and evolve your org structure with confidence.

## How the Flywheel Works

The Flywheel spins through four key movements:

1. Spot Flow Signals
Notice early signs of friction in how teams, services, or leadership operate.

1. Apply Fast Flow Plays
Use repeatable, context-aware plays to respond to signals.

1. Capture Flow Decisions
Make structural and interaction-related decisions visible and testable.

1. Build a Flow Roadmap
Organize decisions in a Now‚ÄìNext‚ÄìLater roadmap to track progress and alignment.

And then? You repeat.
Each spin of the Flywheel reduces ambiguity, decentralizes ownership, and helps your organization learn how to change.

## What Makes the Flywheel Powerful?

üß† Reduces cognitive load for facilitators and decision-makers

üß© Connects strategy to structure through small, safe-to-try moves

üîÅ Works across contexts‚Äîteams, platforms, operations, leadership

üìà Builds momentum instead of waiting for big-bang reorgs

## Who Uses the Flywheel?

- Facilitators guiding change in teams or services
- Coaches supporting leadership or platform teams
- Org designers validating new team boundaries
- Strategic leaders looking to decentralize change

Whether you're embedded in a delivery team or leading org design, the Flywheel gives you a shared process and vocabulary to build momentum.
