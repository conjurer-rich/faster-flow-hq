When your org is built for yesterday, even small changes feel hard. Faster Flow gives you tools to uncover misalignments, guide better structural decisions, and evolve with purpose—not chaos.

## You’re trying to…

- Align teams with strategy
- Reduce friction between teams
- Design structures that adapt over time
- Avoid yet another failed reorg

But without a clear picture of how value flows—or where it’s blocked—it’s impossible to lead change with confidence.

## What Faster Flow gives you

**Clarity** – Map current value flow, user needs, and where misalignment lives

**Confidence** – Use Flow Decision Records to guide and document the “why” behind every change

**Credibility** – Bring leaders and teams into the process with visual, participatory methods

---

## Techniques you can use right now

- **User Needs Mapping** – identify where boundaries should shift
- **Flow Signals Radar** – assess where friction is slowing you down
- **Flow Clinics** – co-create decisions with those closest to the work
