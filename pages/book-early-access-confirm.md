Thanks for putting your hand up. I'll be inviting a small group of early readers to preview chapters, tools, and examples before the book is published.

You won't just be reading, you'll be helping shape the final product. That means:

- Getting access to selected chapters before anyone else
- Seeing draft versions of things like the Fast Flow Toolkit and the Flow Decision Records
- Sharing your feedback on what's clear, what's missing, and what needs sharpening

## What happens next?

I'll be in touch soon with the first preview chapter and a short feedback form.
Keep an eye on your inbox.

If you have any specific areas you'd love to see covered, feel free to reply to the last email or drop me a note at [rich@fasterflowhq.com](mailto:rich@fasterflowhq.com).

While you're here, if you haven't already, can you [fill in this short form](/help-shape-the-book) to share more about your goals and challenges, it helps ensure the book speaks to what matters most.
